Emscripten Test Suite
=====================

Emscripten has a comprehensive test suite, which covers virtually all Emscripten functionality. These tests are an excellent resource for developers as they provide practical examples of most features, and are known to build successfully on the master branch. There are also :ref:`benchmark tests <emscripten-benchmark-tests>` that can be used to test how close Emscripten is getting to native speed.

This article explains how to run the test and benchmark suite, and provides an overview of what tests are available.

Running the whole test suite
============================

The whole core test suite can be run using the script `tests/runner.py <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/master/tests/runner.py>`_: 

.. code-block:: bash

    python tests/runner.py
	
.. note:: 

	- This may take several hours.
	- :term:`Node.js` cannot run all of the tests in the suite; if you need to run them all, you should get a recent trunk version of the `SpiderMonkey <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell>`_ shell. On Windows you can install and activate *SpiderMonkey* using the :ref:`emsdk`.

Running a specific test
=======================

You can also use *runner.py* to run different parts of the test suite, or individual tests. For example, you would run test named ``test_hello_world`` as shown:

.. code-block:: bash

    python tests/runner.py test_hello_world
	
Tests in the "core" test suite (``tests/test_core.py``) can be run as above. Other tests may need a prefix, for example ``browser.test_cubegeom`` for a test in ``tests/test_browser.py``. You can also specify an optional prefix for tests in core, to run them with extra options, for example ``asm2.test_hello_world`` will run ``hello_world`` using ``asm2`` opts (basically ``-O2``). See more examples in :ref:`emscripten-test-suite-list-of-tests`.

Test modes
==========

By default tests are run without optimizations. You can specify a *mode* prefix (e.g. ``asm1.``) to compile a test with optimisations:

.. code-block:: bash

	# Run test in asm1 mode	(-O1 optimizations).
	python tests/runner.py asm1.test_hello_world   
	
	# Run test in all modes.
	python tests/runner.py ALL.test_hello_world 

Some of the main modes are:

- ``ALL``: Run test in all modes.
- ``asm1``: Compile test with :ref:`-O1 <emcc-O1>` optimizations.
- ``asm2``: Compile test with :ref:`-O2 <emcc-O2>` optimizations.
- ``asm3``: Compile test with :ref:`-O3 <emcc-O3>` optimizations.
- ``asm2f``: Compile test with :ref:`-O2 <emcc-O2>` and ``-s PRECISE_F32=1``.
- ``asm2g``: Compile test with :ref:`-O2 <emcc-O2>`  optimizations, :ref:`-g <emcc-g>`, ``-s ASSERTIONS=1`` and ``-s SAFE_HEAP=1``.

Modes are documented at the end of `/tests/test_core.py <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_core.py#L7099>`_.


.. _emscripten-benchmark-tests:

Benchmark tests
===============

You can view `Emscriptenâ€™s current benchmark test results <http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=11&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-ubench>`_ online. These are created by compiling a sequence of benchmarks and running them several times, then reporting averaged statistics including a comparison of how fast the same code runs when compiled to a native executable.

You can run the tests yourself using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python tests/runner.py benchmark

Common tests
============

Below is a list of some common tests/example commands. These include a comment explaining what each test does.

.. code-block:: bash

	# Run all (core) tests
	python tests/runner.py                          

	# Run hello world test, in default mode
	python tests/runner.py test_hello_world

	# Run it in asm1 mode
	python tests/runner.py asm1.test_hello_world   
	
	# Run it in all modes
	python tests/runner.py ALL.test_hello_world 

	# Run all (core) tests in asm1 mode	
	python tests/runner.py asm1 

	# Run all "other" tests - that have no mode	
	python tests/runner.py other

	# Run a specific test in "other"	
	python tests/runner.py other.test_static_link 

	# Run all browser tests	
	python tests/runner.py browser
	
	# Run a specific browser test	
	python tests/runner.py browser.test_sdlglshader 
	
	# Run all network tests. Note that you can also run specific tests (sockets.test_*)
	python tests/runner.py sockets

	# Run all sanity tests. Note that you can also run specific tests (sanity.test_*)	
	python tests/runner.py sanity

	# Run all benchmarks. Note that you can also run specific tests (benchmark.test_*)	
	python tests/runner.py benchmark                



Debugging test failures
=======================

Setting the :ref:`debugging-EMCC_DEBUG` is useful for debugging tests, as it emits debug output and intermediate files from the compilation process:

.. code-block:: bash

	# On Windows, use "set" to set and un-set the EMCC_DEBUG environment variable:
	set EMCC_DEBUG=1 
	python tests/runner.py test_hello_world
	set EMCC_DEBUG=0
	
	# On Linux, you can do this all in one line
	EMCC_DEBUG=1 python tests/runner.py test_hello_world
	
	# EMCC_DEBUG=2 generates additional debug information.
	EMCC_DEBUG=2 python tests/runner.py test_hello_world


You can also specify ``EM_SAVE_DIR=1`` in the environment to save the temporary directory that the test runner uses into **/tmp/emscripten_temp/**. This is a test suite-specific feature, and is useful for tests that create temporary files.

The :ref:`Debugging` topic provides more guidance on how to debug Emscripten-generated code.
